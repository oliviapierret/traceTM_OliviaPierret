| 8  | **Programming languages used, and associated libraries:** Python: csv                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 9  | **Key data structures (for each sub-project):** classes, dictionaries, lists, sets, tuples                                                                                                                                                     |
| 10 | **General operation of code (for each subproject):** <br>The NTM class is initialized with machine information and uses BFS to explore configurations. It tracks visited states to avoid cycles. Transitions are processed until the machine accepts, rejects, or exceeds the maximum steps.      |
| 11 | **What test cases you used/added, why you used them, what did they tell you about the correctness of your code:** <br>I included 4 strings that I knew were correct, ensuring they ended in accept states with varied lengths. I also tested 2 strings not in the language and one that exceeded max transitions. All worked as expected. |
| 12 | **How you managed the code development:** <br>I began by selecting a regular expression (`a+b*`) and creating the machine description CSV. The NTM class was implemented step by step, with debugging and validation through test cases.                                                        |
| 13 | **Detailed discussion of results:** <br>The tests showed the NTM correctly handling valid and invalid strings. Longer strings demonstrated nondeterminism due to branching paths.                                                                                 |
| 14 | **How team was organized:** Worked individually                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 15 | **What you might do differently if you did the project again:** Plan better before starting coding to reduce rework.                                                                                                                           |
